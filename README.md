# Stock-Prices-Predictor
This is a web app that uses machine learning to predict stock prices based on historical data and inputs you provide. Itâ€™s a complete project that covers everything from preparing the data and training the model to building a simple, easy-to-use interface for real-world applications


This README file outlines a project to develop a stock price prediction model using machine learning techniques.

Key aspects:

Data:

Sources: Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or financial data APIs.
Features: Technical indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD), fundamental data (EPS, P/E ratio), and potentially company news.

Methodology:

Model selection: Regression models (Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs like LSTM and GRU), and time series forecasting models like Prophet.
Model training: Data splitting, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation using metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.

Implementation:

Python with libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and visualization tools.
Organized project structure with data, source code, models, and notebooks.

Results & Discussion:

Presentation of model performance, analysis of strengths and weaknesses, and discussion of limitations and future improvements.
